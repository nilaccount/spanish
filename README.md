Workflow Examples
===

1. Write in english and translate in spanish the sentence. My assumption is that we tend to remember words tied to our own experiences.
2. Read in spanish what you choose. For example I came across https://www.facebook.com/microcontos and I assume it's something with literature. Finding this resource is part of my experience thus I'd say I'm more vested to learn from this page instead of a random "learn spanish" program. I copy/paste one sentence: "Todos os dias tentava ser perfeita, mesmo sabendo que isso era perfeitamente imposs√≠vel.". This is a reading material. What strategy should I employ to recall this word in 7 days?
